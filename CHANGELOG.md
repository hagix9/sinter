# Changelog

All notable changes to Sinter are documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-13

First public release of Sinter.

### Added

- Agentless configuration management over SSH.
- `validate`, `plan`, and `apply` workflows.
- YAML and TOML recipe frontends.
- File, directory, template, link, command, package, and service resources.
- Resource dependencies, loops, variables, and delayed service handlers.
- Idempotent stateful resource management.
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS amd64 support.
- `apt` package management.
- `systemd` service management.
- OpenSSH transport with strict `known_hosts` verification.
- Non-interactive privilege escalation through `sudo -n`.
- Text and JSON output.
- Sensitive-value redaction.
- Fail-fast execution and explicit failed/indeterminate result reporting.
- Atomic file publication and filesystem parent-path safety checks.

### Security and safety

- Plan mode performs observation only and does not mutate target state.
- Apply re-observes resources immediately before mutation decisions.
- Unknown or changed SSH host keys are rejected.
- Non-default SSH ports require an explicit `[host]:port` identity.
- Unexpected symlinks and unsafe parent paths are rejected.
- Indeterminate mutations are not automatically retried.
- Verification failures are promoted to failed execution where appropriate.

### Supported environment

The v0.1 reference target is:

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- amd64
- OpenSSH
- apt
- systemd
- `/bin/sh`
- passwordless `sudo -n` when privilege escalation is required

### Known limitations

- RHEL-family distributions are not supported in v0.1.
- Hashed `known_hosts` entries are not supported.
- Sinter does not provide inventory, roles, plugins, orchestration, or embedded scripting.
- Managed hosts require no Sinter agent or runtime.
